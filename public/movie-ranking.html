<p>Batman is called Batman because Bruce Wayne chose the name to strike fear into the criminals of Gotham City. He was afraid of bats, and by adopting the persona of a bat, he used his greatest fears against his enemies</p>
<h3>Ford v Ferrari</h3>

<p>The Ford vs Ferrari rivalry is famously depicted in the film "Ford v Ferrari" (2019), which tells the story of American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles as they work to build a revolutionary race car for Ford to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.</p>
